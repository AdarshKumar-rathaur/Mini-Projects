## 🎮 Featured Project: Whack-A-Mole

My first addition to this repository is a functional **Whack-A-Mole** game. It challenges the player's reflexes with a mole that appears progressively faster as the score increases.

### Key Features:
* **Dynamic Difficulty:** The spawn rate increases based on your current score.
* **Chance System:** Players have 3 "chances." Clicking an empty hole results in a penalty.
* **Responsive Design:** Built using CSS Grid and Flexbox for a seamless experience across different screen sizes.
